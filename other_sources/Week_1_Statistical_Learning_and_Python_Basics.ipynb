    "   - **Goal**: Build models that capture the relationship between variables (features) and predict new outcomes or provide insight into how different variables are related.\n",
    "   - **Supervised Learning**: Input features (X) and corresponding outputs (Y) are used to train models. Examples include regression and classification.\n",
    "   - **Unsupervised Learning**: No labeled output (Y). Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Concepts**\n",
    "   - **Training vs. Test Sets**: A model is trained on a subset of data and tested on new data to assess its performance.\n",
    "   - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: A balance between a model being too simple (high bias) or too complex (high variance).\n",
    "   - **Prediction vs. Inference**: Predicting future observations vs. understanding relationships between variables.\n",
